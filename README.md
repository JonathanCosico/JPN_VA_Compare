# JPN VA COMPARE

This small program was created because I love seeing where voice actors appear in various roles. For example, one of the things that drew me to play Genshin Impact was the amount of voice actors that also voiced some of my favorite characters in Anime

Essentially, I started playing another game, Cookie Run: Kingdom, and according to social media, there were a lot of intersections between the VAs but no definitive list of them.

What this program does is scrape the info from the Japanese Voice Actor Wiki to put compare a list of voice actors (and their respective character) from each game/source
